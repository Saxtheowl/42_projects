lets try to do all the projects of the 42 schools using autonomous llm agents

we gonna use codex gpt 5 and claude 4.5 in their own repository

All the subjects files from the school come from https://github.com/TheoM-e/All-42-subject Thanks a lot :)

v1 is simply something like this prompt and we let it go while using script that ask him to continue every 10m
codex is doing okay and has done 10 projects but then we have to exit the window and launch a new one, which is not suitable, claude seem to fail way early on
